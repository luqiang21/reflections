When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  when I want to create a file that is contributed by several members. Or when I want to work on a project from different computers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	It might have confict with what I have done on local repository.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	forks, when you want to make changes on other's branches and do not have permission to the branch
	clones, when you want to make changes on a branch on your local computer 
	branches, existing on GitHub and Local repository

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
	Then you can compare your local pregress with the state of the remote.
